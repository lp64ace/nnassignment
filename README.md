## Feedforward Neural Network with Backpropagation for Multi-Class Classification

This repository contains code and analysis for a machine learning assignment implementing a feedforward neural network (NN) to perform multi-class classification using supervised learning techniques. The assignment is completed in two parts:

    1. Intermediate Task:
		A comparison of the Nearest Neighbor (NN) classifier (using 1 and 3 neighbors) 
		with the Nearest Class Centroid (NCC) classifier on a chosen dataset.
    2. Main Task:
		Implementation of a fully-connected (MLP) or convolutional (CNN) 
		feedforward neural network that trains using backpropagation to solve a multi-class classification problem. 
		The model is evaluated using training and testing performance, misclassification analysis, 
		and performance comparison with the intermediate task's classifiers.
